<h3>Further development and maintenance issues</h3>

          <div class="container" id="maintenance">  
	<p>Further developments of the project include the forthcoming <strong>release of new tools and merchandising</strong> conceived to improve the users interaction and engagement as well as to assure the project sustainability.<br>
	To achieve these goals, the creation of a network of <strong>partnerships and/or sponsorships</strong> with economic and cultural related realities	will be welcomed. These relationship will also increase the project <strong>visibility</strong> and the possibility to have <strong>social media adertising revenues</strong> - an example have been shown in the <a href="2_1.html" target="_blank">Sofia scenario</a>.</br>
	Some of our proposal are illustrated in the <a href="index.html#further_dev" target="_blank">Forthcoming section</a> and briefly listed below:</p>

	<h3>Search for your pet application</h3>
	<p><a href="index.html#3cta" target="_blank"><strong>Search for your pet</strong></a> is a tool able to help people who lost their pets by loading, sharing, and visualizing <strong>geolocated data</strong> of their missing pets. The user will have the possibility to fill in a form that will structure data similarly to those seen in the Preliminary data section; other users could improve information in case they have seen the lost-pet.</p>

	<h3>Funny merchandising - 3d print your pet</h3>
	<p>The idea is to develop a tool to realize a 3d printed little modelling of our pet, starting from uploading a 360Â° video. The merchandising unit will be in charge to realize and send home to the users the realized 3d print that will be used as a gift or a little celebrating statue.</p>

	<h3>Funny merchandising - Panini Trading cards and album</h3>
	<p>Starting from the strong tradition of the Panini Trading cards and album, already offering personalized products from their <a href="https://digitalcollection.mypanini.com/" target="_blank">website and applications</a>, we thought to realize a <strong>Panini Trading cards and album Wanted! edition</strong>. <br>Looking for the missing card among other passionated will improve engagement and experience sharing.</p>

	<h3>Educational merchandising - Memory and Guess Who? board games (and online versions)</h3>
	<div><p>Scientific literature shows that board games and their online versions, are useful tool to improve learning ability and social interaction rate. This is why we would like to propose a Wanted! edition for two traditional board games that have been declined in the years in several versions (Star Wars ed., Disney ed., etc.).
