            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<h3>The Concept</h3>  
	 	  
  	<div class="container" id="Museological">
      <h4>The museological approach</h4>
      
	 <p>We then started to think about the topic in a museological view trying to find the best way to translate it into a cultural journey.<br>
Since the theme belongs to an emotional conceptuality, a good idea could be to express it through a story that accompanies the user as in a journey, articulated in simple steps repeated for every artist considered as:</p>
<ul>
<ol>1.  A brief introduction on the pet artist story</ol>
<ol>2.  More info about the artist</ol>
<ol>3.  More info about the pet</ol>
<ol>4.  The Artist’ room - Gallery: showing some of their work related to the human-pet bound</ol>
<ol>5.  The Artist’ room - Work of art portraying the pet: showing the specific work of art</ol>
<ol>6.  Further suggestions to know more about the topic</ol>
</ul><br>

<h5>The Virtual Exhibition</h5>
<p>
We then created a “classic” Virtual Exhibition based on the <a href="https://www.omeka.net/" target="_blank">Omeka.net</a> free trial version, a tool that allowed us to create a database of work of art, collections, and exhibition path, as well as to propose to the user advanced tools for search and browse through the items proposed.<br>
To this scope, we completed the museological path for two pilot artists – Frida Kahlo and Giosetta Fioroni – while we limited just to list other possible artist-pet relationship to be explored such as Pablo Picasso and Lump, Henry Matisse and Minouche, Dalì and Babou, etc.</p>
<br></div>
		
<div class="container">
<h5>The Interactive application and the 3d room</h5>
<p>We also devised a more <strong>interactive application “Choose your guide”</strong> that give the possibility to explore the exhibition with a freer path but with the help of a proper guide, instead of being autonomous in reading the critical parts and linearly scroll the contents, and the guide will also suggest further activities at the end of the visit to engage more the user.<br>
The visit is then divided in rooms, accordingly with the path of the Virtual linear exhibition, each of which is dedicated to a different artist and its bond with their pet and other animals. The virtual room is showed as a real museum room (walls, sofa, paints with panels), the paintings have an interactive panel trough which (by clicking it) the user can visualize the work and go into detail.</p><br>

<div class="container">
<h5>Virtual Exhibition and Interaction Application classification</h5>
<p>
The application, whose details will be discussed in the Development section, has then engagement and education as primary goals; our cultural environment can be classified in the E or F category, according to Simona Caraceni taxonomy:</p>
<cite><ul>
<ol>E) Virtual museum that enhance museum objects INTERPRETATION with OPEN INTERACTION in an OPEN SPACE showing SELECTED (or ALL OBJECTS) of the museum collection, ALLOWING visitor CONTRIBUTIONS.</ol>
<ol>F) Virtual museum making EXPERIMENTS with NEW MUSEOLOGICAL MODELs with OPEN INTERACTION in an OPEN SPACE showing SELECTED (or ALL OBJECTS) of the museum collection, ALLOWING visitor CONTRIBUTIONS.</ol>
</ul></cite></p>

	<table>
        <tr><td>NEED</td><td>Interpretaton - Experimentation/complex museum identity</td></tr>
        <tr><td>INTERACTION</td><td>Open</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SPACE</td><td>Open</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CONTENT</td><td>Selected works - Photograph, texts, geo-referenced material</td></tr>

        <tr><td>VISITORS CONTRIBUTIONS</td><td>Allowed</td></tr>
        </table>
	</p>
	
<p>To classify the Interactive application proposed - Choose your guide - we used the <strong>V-MUST (1-8)</strong> and <strong>Hornecker-Ciolfi (9.1-9.3)</strong> classifications:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>1. By Content</td><td>human-pet affective relationship</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. By Interaction technology</td><td>device-based, speech-based</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. By Duration</td><td>basically short; depending on the user's choices</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. By Communication</td><td>narrative, dramatization</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. By Level of immersion</td><td>medium</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. By Format</td><td>desktop and mobile, on line</td></tr>
<tr><td>7. By Scope</td><td>education, engagement</td></tr>
<tr><td>8. By Sustainability</td><td>to be analysed</td></tr>
<tr><td>9.1 Relationship to the Museum Environment-Space and Visitor Mobility</td><td>mobile interaction</td></tr>
<tr><td>9.2 Relation to the form of augmentation and experience</td><td>extended Reality: VR</td></tr>
<tr><td>9.3 Interaction beyond the physical visit</td><td>post-visit: engaging the visitor; pre-visit: preparing visit</td></tr>
