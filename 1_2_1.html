	  <h4>Specific CH topic selected as case study. Where the idea comes from</h4>
		    
          <p>A corpus of lost pets advertisements, collected between 2014 and 2020 in different places around the world, was the starting point of our project. Part of this collection is available in the <a href="index.html#preliminary_data">Preliminary data</a> section, which also contains specific pages for three sample flyers (Nobu, Gringo and Luli); in those pages the data, previously spread in the free-text in natural language, have been organized in a table with controlled fields such as the <strong>pet name</strong>, the <strong>type of pet</strong>, and </strong>keywords</strong>.</p>

          <p>The preliminary data have been then used as an observation set through which extracting information to define our <a href="2_1.html" target="_blank">Personae</a> because we immediately noticed recursive patterns in the composition - both visual and textual - of these leaflets that could be helpful to extract some information about the producers.</p>

          <h6>ANALYSIS on the preliminary data</h6>
<p>These repeated features revealed a strong communicative and emotive engagement from “the human” creating the flyer, looking for its lost pets but also trying to share all the love of the relationship and the emotive pain of this missing.<br>
We have been particularly impressed by the sentimental value that most of these flyers express about the affective tie between the lost pet and their humans.</p><br>
        
          <div>
          <iframe src="Nobu.html" width="33%" height="900vh"></iframe>
          <iframe src="Gringo.html" width="33%" height="900vh"></iframe>
          <iframe src="Luli.html" width="33%" height="900vh"></iframe>        
          </div><br>
          
          <p>From a <strong>visual viewpoint</strong>, a recurrent pattern is the manual intervention of the caregiver to make the visual communication more expressive, manually colouring black-and-white A4 b/w laser-printed copy. Examples are shown in the Gringo, Luli and Biyu announcement: “collar verde” or “vestidito rojo” “camiseta de argentina”.</p>
		  <p>
		  From a <strong>textual point of view</strong>, affection diminutives are really common - “caniche” (little dog), “vestidito” (little dress), "patitas"(little paw), "pechitos" (little brest).<br>
		  
		  In addition, Gringo and Polaco are talking in <strong>first person</strong> “Me perdì” (I got lost); other pets are referred with “ella” or “she” <strong>pronouns</strong>; in the flyer for Nobu, "GATTO CERTOSINO (Grigio, pelo lucente)", the cat is defined by the words <strong>"timido" (shy)</strong> and <strong>"tonto" (dumb)</strong>:  all these are clear exemplifications of the humanising of animals, namely the attribution of human's traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities.</p>

			<p>The tendency of humanizing domestic animals has a strong tradition, even in the scientific milieu, and some references have been reported in a specific <a href="4.html" target="_blank">bibliography section</a>. For example, Soviet linguist Yuri Knorozov, known for being the first to decipher the Maya script, is said to have proposed his Siamese cat Asya as co-author of some of his works because the observation of Asya’s behaviour while teaching her kittens to hunt inspired one of his work on signs and communication.. In 1975, Jack Hetherington and F.D.C. Willard published a paper together (Hetherington, J.H., and F.D.C. Willard. <cite>Two-, Three-, and Four-atom Exchange Effects in Bcc He3.</cite> Physical Review Letters 35.21 (1975): 1442-444) but just one of them was a human…</p>

          <h5>ANALYSIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA</h5>

        <p>Due to the new scenarios brought by the era of digitalization and virtual socialisation, we decided to also explore the social media situation, in order to have an overview about the impact of animals in general and pet in particular in that context.<br>
        As shown in some examples of profiles provided below, nowadays, animals are still humanized also via the social media, becoming protagonists of social posts and even owners of social media pages, with big success and millions of followers.<br>
        An overall presentation of these analysis can be found in the <a href="index.html#social_data">On Social media</a> data section.</p>
