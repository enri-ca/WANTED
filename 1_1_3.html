<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>The Context</h3>


            <div class="container row" id="Audience">
          <h5>The target audience with characteristics, motivations, capabilities and devices</h5>
		  
		  		<p>
				From the same previous step of the Ideation Cards, we could outline that the two institutions had more point of contacts in the target audience than in the assets: in fact, they share the two categories of <strong>art and animal passionate</strong> as well as the part of <strong>users enjoying collections online</strong>. <br>
				All these audiences are <strong>quite familiar with technological devices</strong> that they are used to use for several daily tasks (find an address, search for a professional, sending and receiving email and instant messaging, etc.)<br>
				On these bases, we created the <a href="2_1.html" target="_blank">Personas</a> - as defined by the Alan Cooper method - available in the Development section.
