      As we have seen in the development of the institutional goals, the virtual exhibition and the related applications cover several goals in different areas.<br>
In particular, these are the three main goals the interactive application wants to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cognitive</strong>: increase visitor participation via engagement through the personalized guide and beyond the visit services (educational merchandising, “Share your story”, future “Search for your pet”, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Cultural and educational</strong>: attract new demographics to art history</li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong>: increase online visits and connected revenues (Instagram posts, partnertship and sponsorships, etc.)</li>
</ul>
