            <h5>Reference institutions</h5>
			When we started thinking about this project, from the already mentioned corpus, we have been inspired by <strong>memorial museums and installations</strong> such as the<a href="https://www.museomemoriaustica.it/il-museo/" target="_blank">Museo per la Memoria di Ustica</a> – realized by Christian Boltanski, artist specially devoted to memory and memorial issues – or the <a href="https://www.storiaememoriadibologna.it/sacrario-partigiani-in-piazza-nettuno-a-bologna-892-opera" target="_blank">Sacrario partigiani in Piazza Nettuno a Bologna</a> started as a spontaneous initiative of Bologna’s inhabitants, or the Argentinian <a href="https://apm.gov.ar/apm/portada" target="_blank">Archivo Provincial de la Memoria/Ex D2</a>. All these institutions are devoted to preserve the public testimony of historical facts as well as to celebrate the intimate memory of missed beloved-ones.<br>
			However, even if a strong memorial component was present in our inspirational material, we would also find the way to celebrate the <strong>joyful</strong> part of the relationship with the – hopefully momentarily – lost pets. </p>
			<p>For this part we explored some examples such as those mentioned by Simona Caraceni in her Mewselogy course slides             (Hermitage cats army guards, <a href="https://bigcomicbros.net/work/6195/" target="_blank">Le chat du Louvre</a>, 
            <a href="http://catsmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Cat Museum Kotor</a> and Cats Museum Malaysia) and other similar as the <a href="https://www.kattenkabinet.nl/" target="_blank">KattenKabinet (Cat Cabinet)</a> in Amsterdam. These references often <strong>celebrate individual pets or are "species-dependent"</strong> (celebrating only dogs, or cats, etc.).<br>
			Instead, our project demands for an institution exploring the complex emotive human-pet relationship, independently from the reference to a particular species.</p>
			
			<p>The <a href="in_art.html">In Art</a> section is conceived as a Virtual Exhibition about this topic. The idea, involving famous visual artists, is to achieve the double goal of humanising the artist and making their emotive world closer to that of the user. We chose to build an exhibition path on the relationship of some artists and their pets: <strong>Frida Kahlo and Granizo</strong>, <strong>Giosetta Fioroni and Petote</strong>, <strong>Pablo Picasso and Lump</strong>, <strong>Henry Matisse and Minouche</strong>, <strong>Salvador Dalí and Babou</strong>, etc. <br>
			The Virtual Exhibition, as <strong>sketched for Frida Kahlo and Giosetta Fioroni</strong>, collects different contents – paintings, photographs, books, etc. - belonging to different cultural institutions in order to build a museological path with different way of fruition (a <em>classic</em> Virtual Exhibition, interactive applications, 3d artists room exploration, etc.)</p>
		   <p>
		   The visitor will be also engaged with the possibility of loading and sharing their personal stories in <a href="index.html#your_stories">Your Stories</a> section via the <strong>Share your story</strong> tool.<p>
		   <p>Further developments of the project include the forthcoming release of a tool “Search for your pet” to help people to share their missed pet advertisement by loading, sharing, and visualizing geolocated data of their missing pets.<br>
		   A <strong>merchandising section</strong> will also propose funny or educational items for sale.</p>
