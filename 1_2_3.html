        <h4>Ideation Cards</h4>
		<p>Afer having used the Ideation Cards in the definition of the <strong>Relevant assets and Target audience in The contex (STAGE 1 - Define context</strong>), they also helped us to go on with the following steps of ideation.<br>
		In this stage, we decided to continue to analyse and develop both the scenarios: a virtual initiative located in a real museum, and a virtual museum located exclusively online.<br>
			At the end of <strong>STAGE 3</strong>, we definetly decided to go for the Virtual Exhibition and related applications.

  <h5>STAGE 2 – Define Institutional goals</h5>
  <p>The goals we thought to set for both the institutions were quite similar (5/8) even if with different ranking: the common best ranked one is to <strong>increase the online visits</strong> the others are related in different ways to improve the educational impact and the social engagement (Attract new demographics, Change visitor attitudes and beliefs, Use assets in new ways, Increase outreach).</p>

  <h5>STAGE 3 – Create design brief</h5>

	</p>
	<p>The final design brief for the <strong>physical institution</strong> designed the <strong>3d print your pet application</strong> with the following characteristics: devoted to the <strong>goal of increasing the visitor partecipation</strong>, oriented to the <strong>target audience of casual turist</strong> through the <strong>retail asset</strong>.<br>
In particular, we devised the possibility to engage the casual tourists, that who could encounter <strong>barriers</strong> due to the <strong>low visibility (hidden)</strong> of the museum or the <strong>unavailable mobile connection poor signage</strong>, via the <strong>smart phones devices</strong> they are provided of during the travel or via <strong>computers</strong> they have at home before the visit; the museum could offer in site or off-site a <strong>3d printer</strong> service to 3d print a model of their pet.<br>
<strong>Motivations</strong> to visit the place or use the service include <strong>curiosity and nostalgia</strong>; <strong>capabilities</strong> required or assumed are the familiar use of <strong>mobile apps and websites</strong> while the <strong>3d modelling</strong> is previewed as to be improved.</p>

<p>In this section we found really useful the use of ideation cards, this tool helped us with the delineation of the project taking into account more other aspects. First, the goal that at the end of the project we would the visitor to reach; in this case, we didn’t think this project as primary dedicated to the culture expansion, it has not didactical goals, but it is possible to reach them. Anyway, the most important aim that this project want to reach is the increasing of the outreach; how? First, by creating a safe space of sharing where to find empathy and build a social network, and second, in a more pragmatic way, by providing useful tools to share a personal experience.
The motivations are at the base of the goals, inclusion and personal relevance are those feelings that the user must feel at the end of its experience.
The star asset is, obviously, the digital resource, since the initiative is present exclusively on the web; at the same time, the user doesn’t need a particular knowledge of the digital tools, it is sufficient to have a minimal knowledge of how to use a computer in its most simple functionalities.
It can be a barrier too, if the user doesn’t have one of the devices needed to visualise the experience or an even minimal knowledge of the technology.</p>  </div>
