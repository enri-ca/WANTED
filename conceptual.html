  <h2>FIRST STEP</h2>
  <h3>WHERE THE IDEA COME FROM</h3>

  <p> Between 2014 and 2020 Enrica started to collect, through her camera, all the most interesting papers of lost animals she met on her road, in different places around the world.</p>
  <p><b>QUI PENSAVO CARTELLA EMBEDDATA </b></p>
  <p>She was particularly impressed by the sentimental value that some of this announcements could express about the affective tie between the lost animals and their owners.</p>
  

  <p>WORDS</p>
  <p>The expressive power of the words used to describe the physical and comportamental aspect of the animal was the most interesting part; indeed it made us thinking about these particular aspect in a more wide view, including all the potential fields in which it coulded be interesting to study in deep this affective value.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>QUI PENSAVO DI INSERIRE UNA PICCOLA DIGRESSIONE SU ANALISI DEI CARTELLI + PAROLE ESPRESSIVE + CAMPIONAMENTO DEGLI ESEMPI (FUNZIONALE ALLA DEFINIZIONE DEL TARGET ETC...)</b></p>
  <br>
  <!--<p>At this point we decided to definitelly establish those fields, to start a real project work and search for relevant documentation.
    The final choice was to select three different cultural aspects:
    <ul>
      <li>HISTORY</li>
      <li>ART</li>
      <li>ACTUALITY</li>
    </ul>
  But...which was the specific topic about which study in deep?

  <h2>SECOND STEP</h2>
  <h3>CHOICE OF TOPIC</h3>
<p>Since we already decided to base the project around the general concept of the sentymental value of a human and its animal, the question at this point was how to translate it in an interesting cultural initiative.
The challenge was to not result trivial and at the same time to find a theme that coulded be suitable for both an educational and affective final goal.</p>
<br>
<h4>FIRST ATTEMPT</h4>
<p>"animals in art"</p>
<p><b>QUESTO VA IN TABELLA E APPROFONDITO </b></p>
<p>PROS: Detailed and wide documentation</p>
<p>CONS: Trivial, no sentimental engagement</p>

<p> Focus on the emotional sphere of the artist, not on the work </p>
<p> Find some interesting stories about iconic artists and the bond with their domestic animals</p>
<br>
<h4>SECOND ATTEMPT (FINAL CHOICE)</h4>
<p>"The animal: stories of how the domestic animal inspired its artist"</p>
<p>PROS: humanization of the icon and
         empatization between artist and user</p>
<p>CONS: no detailed documentation</p>
<br>
<h2>THIRD STEP</h2>
<h3>DEFINE THE MUSEOLOGICAL APPROACH</h3>
<p><b>QUI VA AGGIUNTA MOLTA ALTRA ROBA SU: TARGET, SPACE, GOALS, APPROACH</b></p>
<p>Once we found the topic, we started to think about it in a museological view; trying to find the best way to translate it into a cultural journey.</p>
<p> Since the theme belong to an emotional conceptuality, a good idea could be to express it trough a story that accompanies the user trough a journey, articulated in some phases at the end of which the user is free to express his personal story.</p>
<p>The steps that the user encounter during the journey were choose on the base of the educational and sentymental goal that this project want to reach.</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>First</b> Historical view: how the animal revealed itself as important in the most fundamentally striking historical phases.</li>
    <li><b>Second</b> Art: Deepen analysis of works specifically dedicated by the artist to the bond with his domestic animal.</li>
    <li><b>Third</b> DATA: Some statystical analysis focused on the presence of the animal and its value.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><b> QUI METTO TUTTO IL PROCESSO CREATIVO MA USANDO LE CARTE DELLA PESCARIN </b></p>
