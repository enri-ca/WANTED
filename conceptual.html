  <h2>FIRST STEP</h2>
  <h3>WHERE THE IDEA COME FROM</h3>

  <p> Between 2014 and 2020 Enrica started to collect, through her camera, all the most interesting papers of lost animals she met on her road, in different places around the world.</p>
  <p><strong>proposta "As in <a href="index.html#preliminary_data" target="_blank">Preliminary data section</a>"</strong></p>
  <p><iframe style="height: 19vw;" src="assets/img/portfolio#grid" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
  <p><iframe style="height: 19vw;" src="https://drive.google.com/embeddedfolderview?id=1jqpdEX8i9HmnxHqXckQhs7tieuLFgDdd#grid" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
  <p>She was particularly impressed by the sentimental value that some of this notice papers could express about the affective tie between the lost animals and their owners.</p>
  

  <p>WORDS</p>
  <p>The expressive power of the words used to describe the physical and comportamental aspect of the animal was the most interesting part; indeed, it made us thinking about these particular aspect in a more wide view, including all the potential fields in which it coulded be interesting to study in deep this affective value.</p>

  <b>METTERE SCHEMA ANALISI LINGUISTICA (GATTO -> UMANIZZAZIONE -> TIMIDO E TONTO)</b>
  <!--<p>At this point we decided to definitelly establish those fields, to start a real project work and search for relevant documentation.
    The final choice was to select three different cultural aspects:
    <ul>
      <li>HISTORY</li>
      <li>ART</li>
      <li>ACTUALITY</li>
    </ul>
  But...which was the specific topic about which study in deep?
  </p>-->
  

  <h2>SECOND STEP</h2>
  <h3>CHOICE OF TOPIC</h3>
<p>Since we already decided to base the project around the general concept of the sentymental value of a human and its animal, the question at this point was how to translate it in an interesting cultural initiative.
The challenge was to not result trivial and at the same time to find a theme that coulded be suitable for both an educational and affective final goal.</p>
<img src="assets/img/conc.png" width="60%" style="border-radius: 4vw; margin-left: 20%">
<br>

<h4>FIRST ATTEMPT</h4>
<p>"animals in art"</p>
<p><b>QUESTO VA IN TABELLA E APPROFONDITO </b></p>
<p>PROS: Detailed and wide documentation</p>
<p>CONS: Trivial, no sentimental engagement</p>

<p> Focus on the emotional sphere of the artist, not on the work </p>
<p> Find some interesting stories about iconic artists and the bond with their domestic animals</p>
<br>
<h4>SECOND ATTEMPT (FINAL CHOICE)</h4>
<p>"The animal: stories of how the domestic animal inspired its artist"</p>
<p>PROS: humanization of the icon and
         empatization between artist and user</p>
<p>CONS: no detailed documentation</p>
<br>
<h2>THIRD STEP</h2>
<h3>DEFINE THE MUSEOLOGICAL APPROACH</h3>
<img src="assets/img/concep.png" width="60%" style="border-radius: 4vw; margin-left: 20%;">
<p><b>QUI VA AGGIUNTA MOLTA ALTRA ROBA SU: TARGET, SPACE, GOALS, APPROACH</b></p>
<p>Once we found the topic, we started to think about it in a museological view; trying to find the best way to translate it into a cultural journey.</p>
<p> Since the theme belong to an emotional conceptuality, a good idea could be to express it trough a story that accompanies the user trough a journey, articulated in some phases at the end of which the user is free to express his personal story.</p>
<p>The steps that the user encounter during the journey were choose on the base of the educational and sentymental goal that this project want to reach.</p>

<p><b>CREATING PROCESS: DESIGN CARDS</b></p>
<p>The (.....) designed by (.....) are a tool that we found very interesting and useful to fix in a more museological approach our project; their use helped us to frame all the ideas in a  certain standard and to define all the practical aspects of the work that had to be done.
In this phase of ideation we decided to continue to develop both the ideas: that about a virtual initiative located in a real museum, and that about a virtual museum located exclusively online.</p>

<p>PHYSICAL REFERENCE INSTITUTION</p>
<p>First, we decided to deepen the idea related to a physical reference institution; the concept was: develope an interactive app, mobile-interaction based, trough which the visitor could be able to interact with the exhibit using its own mobile-device (a smartphone or a tablet).
<p>

<p> <b>SEZIONE MUSEO VIRTUALE> </b>

<p> PERSONAE </p>
<p> SCENARIO </p>


<h3>THE EXPERIENCE (CREATING PROCESS)</h3>
<p>After a long creative process, we concluded that the best way to provide a both empathetic and didactic 'visit' was a virtual museum.
The museum is divided in rooms, each of which is dedicated to a different artist and its bond with the animal as entity. 
The virtual room is structured in the following way: it is showed as a real museum room (walls, sofa, paints with panels), the paints we choosed to insert inside the space are the most representative of a connection with an animal; each paint has an interactive panel trough which (by clicking it) the user can visualize the work and go into detail.
The information section showed by the panel is divided in some parts; a brief history of the artist, why we choosed him/her for our project and the analysis of most of the emblematic works that can be useful for the user to understand the importance of the animal in the creative processes of the artist.</p>
